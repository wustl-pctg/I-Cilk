# I-Cilk
The I-Cilk (interactive cilk) runtime and benchmarks.

The docker container can be installed by running the build-docker.sh script. The start-docker.sh
script will launch an interactive shell within the docker container. The setup.sh script can be
used to build the runtimes and benchmarks, and the collect_artifact_data.sh can be used to run the
benchmarks relevant to the PLDI 2020 paper "Responsive Parallelism with Futures and State" by
Muller et. al.
